The driving question behind my research is how new technology can support the innovation process. In particular, I examine what I define as collective innovation , an innovation process that harnesses the diverse and untapped human, social, and economic capital from distributed networks to discover, evaluate, and implement new ideas (Ger ber et al., 2019) . Open, ubiquitous social technical infrastructure supports collective innovation, affording greater speed and deeper and broader participation . While collective innovation has the potential to massively transform society, it is poorly understood. I use qualitative, quantitative, and design research methodologies to establish theory, contribute design principles, and develop infrastructure for collective innovation. My pioneering scholarship leads the academy's understanding of this fast-evolving, scalable infrastructure, and directly contributes to its improved functioning to benefit society at large.\n\nThe first premise of collective innovation is that direct interaction between stakeholders can radically enhance rates of innovation (Gerber et al. , 2019; Foong et al., 2017; Gerber and Hui, 216; Gerber, 2014; Gerber and Hui, 2013; Gerber and Carroll, 2012). The second premise is that even across weakly connected, heterogeneous networks, changes in the design of our infrastructure can bring forth effort and resources that would otherwise lie fallow (Foong et al., under review; Hui et al., 2018; Gerber, 2014; Shaw et al, 2014 , Hui et al., 2014; Gerber, 2007). The third premise is that broader participant engagement can expand the breadth of problems addressed and increase the quality of the solutions (Gerber, 2014; Gerber, 2007). This work is embodied in the four ongoing major endeavors of my r esearch career: Crowdfunding, Crowdsourcing, S ocial Innovation Networks, and Design for America.\n\nMy scholarship produces three types of results: 1) theory for collective innovation, 2) design principles, and 3) novel sociotechnical systems to support inclusive and continuous innovation in society. My work has resulted in 60 publications in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, Computer Human Interaction, and Management literatures and ACM Interactions and IEEE Internet Computing trade publications.

The goal is to develop human-centered, human-inspired, and human-compatible AI and robotics.\nHis research is structured around three pillars: human tasks, human data, and human interfaces. He has developed a comprehensive robotic benchmark, BEHAVIOR [1], to simulate the 1,000 most essential household tasks – identified through large-scale survey studies – in virtual, interactive, and ecologically realistic environments. To achieve human-level AI in solving these tasks, he designs systems and learning algorithms that enable AI and robots to learn from large-scale, diverse human data collected through novel interfaces [2-7]. To augment human capabilities and enable seamless interaction, he has developed intelligent brain-robot interfaces to assist older adults, individuals with disabilities, and those receiving hospital care with activities of daily living [8]. In addition to these, for future research, he aims to enhance the generalization capabilities of learning-based robotic systems for everyday tasks by leveraging foundation models [9-12]. At the same time, he is developing robotic systems that surpass human capabilities in high-skill domains such as painting, dancing, cooking, and sports, through the integration of learned world models and advanced planning algorithms.\nHis research “North Star” is that, one day, we will be able to use our brain signals to control intelligent robots to take care of us when needed, or perform highly dexterous tasks that is beyond the limitations of our physical bodies.\nRuohan Zhang has received several paper awards or nominations from robotics conferences and workshops, including two CoRL best paper nominations (2022, 2023), ICRA best paper (2024), best paper nomination (2025), and multiple best paper awards at CoRL, RSS, ICRA, and AAAI workshops. He has also published articles in cognitive science journals such as Neural Computation and PLoS Computational Biology.

The use of multimodal technology is multi-fold. First, the environments that he studies allow students to experience learning across a range of modalities. Second, he uses multimodal signal processing and artificial intelligence to study how student learning is demonstrated across different modalities and time scales. Third, he designs multimodal interfaces that support inclusivity and deepen student learning, while also considering ways to use multimodal data to support student and teacher reflection.", "Research Interests": "\nWorsley's work examines technological innovations for supporting inclusive learning and teaching.

Our work with technological innovations includes: 1) co-designing activities with teachers and learners; 2) creating interfaces that broaden participation in meaningful learning experience; and 3) tools and analytic techniques for studying and supporting complex learning environments. We position our work as inclusive, in that we endeavor to address historic and contemporary disparities in accessibility, inclusivity and social, racial and economic inequity.

She examined the regulation of follicle function in vitro and established a collaboration with a biomaterial scientist, Lonnie Shea, to develop a 3-dimensional support system that would provide the necessary bio-integrity for follicle growth (Tissue Eng. 9:1013, 2003; News and Views in Nat. Med. 14:1178, 2008 and Nat. Med. 14:1182). These studies have been very productive and the current culture system supports live births of mice. The system is being adopted to non-human primate and human ovarian follicles. She coined the term oncofertility to describe this work. Finally, she has used physiological studies together with mathematical modeling to explore the kinetics of follicle formation and persistence in the mouse (Dev. Biol. 298:149 and Dev. Biol. 298:132). These studies reveal the necessary and sufficient nature of the initial follicle pool established in the ovary during the time of development (Nature Med, 14:1190, 2008).

These computational tools have advanced to the point now where materials may be \"synthesized virtually\", with their properties predicted on a computer before ever being synthesized in a laboratory. These tools also open the field of \"materials informatics\" where we can use machine learning tools to explore materials datasets and discover new materials. In this work, we are working towards a goal of being able to suggest new materials in the same way that Netflix and Amazon can recommend movies or books.\n\nWhile the types of materials problems amenable to these tools is extremely wide, we are currently interested in a variety of materials problems with a focus on materials for alternative energies and sustainability (hydrogen, batteries, light-weight metals, fuel cells, thermoelectrics). Current topics of interest include the discovery of novel hydrogen storage materials, phase transformations in metallic and ceramic alloys, microstructural evolution during aging, and the theoretical prediction of new materials.\n\nAnother key research interest involves methodologies for linking atomistic and microstructural length scales. Though first-principles methods are powerful, they are also computationally quite demanding. Current state-of-the-art resources limits the system sizes that one can study to around a few hundred atoms. We have worked on methods that couple first-principles with Monte Carlo methods (capable of simulating millions of atoms), phase-field microstructural models, and CALPHAD calculation of phase diagram tools. These types of hybrid methods are yielding truly predictive models of microstructural evolution and mechanical properties in novel materials.", "Significant Recognition": "- Ford Motor Company Technical Achievement Award, 2006\n- USCAR Recognition Award, 2006\n- Noah Greenberg Award, American Musicological Society, 2006\n- Ford Motor Company Patent Award, 2005\n- Ford Motor Company Publication Award, 2005\n- Ford Environmental, Physical Sciences, and Safety Research Recognition Award, 2003\n- Ford Motor Company Patent Award, 2002", "Significant Professional Service": "- Member, International Commission C20 of IUPAP on Computational Physics, 2006\n- Guest Editor, MRS Bulletin, Sept. 2006\n- TMS Advisory Board, 2003-2004\n- John E.

My research is focused on the development of models for these of these types of problems, and their solution using high performance computing tools. Examples include melting and solidification of metal in advanced manufacturing processes, fluid-structure interaction in the human heart and vascular system, heat transfer in multi-phase flows, and multi-scale transport in environmental systems.", "Selected Publications": "A.

Outputs: We investigate ways microbes modify their metabolic networks and use these modifications to increase production of a given metabolite.\n\nWhy we do it\nSynthetic biology offers a disruptive technology that has vast potential to impact the most important facets of our lives. The way we diagnose diseases, the drugs we use, the fuels we put in our cars, the plastic that is used in our potato chip bag - we have the opportunity to improve the sustainability of our lifestyle.

Such systems abound in the living world, and the resulting assemblies govern critical processes at all levels of life, from the formation of virus capsids to the transport of oxygen in the blood. The Tullman-Ercek lab is interested in several questions related to self-assembling systems: 1) What fundamental principles govern the precise organization of proteins at the nanoscale? 2) How does organization of biochemical processes enhance their performance? 3) How can we manipulate these protein assemblies to gain new or enhanced functions in living and non-living systems? Current model systems include protein containers such as the MS2 viral capsid and bacterial organelles called microcompartments, and membrane protein machines such as the type III secretion system. In the process of trying to engineer these systems to gain or improve function, surprising observations often surface that lead to hypothesis-driven approaches to better understand the native systems.", "Selected Publications": "1.

Recently, Dr. Troy has expanded this effort to consider how the retina changes in disease states and what can be done to retard or reverse these changes. He has been collaborating with Dr. Xiaorong Liu in a study of ocular hypertension. Using a mouse model of glaucoma, they are investigating the progression of the disease and some drug treatments that might be effective in delaying or halting its progression.\nMore recently, Dr. Troy has expanded his interest to include technology development that can be used either to restore neural function or to assist neuroscience research, including the development of therapeutic agents. His laboratory has provided insight into how stimulus waveforms can be shaped to minimize tissue and electrode damage during electrical stimulation. It has developed and tested the effectiveness of nanoscale tipped electrodes for recording extracellular action potentials from mammalian axons in vivo. Since feasibility of nanoscale tips for neural recording has been established, one of the remaining challenges is to customize these tips to reduce impedance and improve recording signal over noise. His laboratory has also developed a new version of the patch clamp electrode which should permit longer term stable recordings of higher bandwidth than existing models. A variant of the system has been developed to avoid run-down of diffusible cytoplasmic compounds, ensuring a more physiological recording situation. The Troy laboratory has also been collaborating with Dr. Laxman Saggere and his students to develop a chemical neural prosthesis for diseases of photoreceptor degeneration. Under ideal conditions, this prosthesis would be implanted in the subretina following photoreceptor degeneration. If this can be accomplished, advantage can be made of the surviving retinal circuitry. One of the major challenges faced is to engineer a device that is flexible, photoactivated and which can incorporate a sufficiently large reservoir of neurotransmitter. This device is targeted for patients with the incurable diseases retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, with incidences of 1-2 and 20-25 million. Finally, Dr. Troy has recently begun a new project to develop a thalamic visual prosthesis. The goal is to implant electrodes into the lateral geniculate nucleus bilaterally to treat patients blinded through glaucoma, optic neuritis or bilateral eye loss. There are 60 million worldwide with glaucoma, 2-5 million with optic neuritis and 2 million with bilateral eye loss. There are many significant engineering challenges to this project, ranging from biocompatibility of the implant to safe charge injection regimens to mechanical mismatch between the electrode materials and brain tissue.\n\n", "Selected Publications": ""},

In one of these programs, the maximum entropy principle was used to determine the probability distribution function for droplet sizes. This is a theoretical study that yielded results that agree with existing and often used empirical relations. Another program is an experimental study to determine the aerodynamic effects of the air flow on the shape of the spray and the trajectories of the droplet. The goal of this research is to obtain design parameters that are needed by designers of aircraft combustors. Combustors using this approach will be smaller in size and eliminate problems of blow-off. A project is underway to numerically model the air flow exiting from a spray-nozzle assembly. Experiments are also planned to check the model.", "Selected Publications": "Tankin, R. S., and X. Li. 1989.

She develops innovative methods for data collection and behavioral modeling that extend beyond traditional economic frameworks—integrating social determinants, environmental concern, user experience, engagement, and simplified decision heuristics that people actually use in daily life.\n\nBy layering these richer dimensions of human motivation onto formal models, her research delivers more realistic, predictive, and actionable insights into travel behavior.\n\nAs transportation systems navigate major transitions—such as boosting lapsed transit ridership, accelerating shifts to alternative fuel or automated vehicles, and guiding sustainable goods‑movement practices—there is growing recognition that next‑generation decision‑support tools must reflect the true complexity of human decision‑making. Dr. Stathopoulos' work provides the empirical foundations and modeling innovations needed to design policies, technologies, and mobility solutions that people will actually adopt.

We have made important contributions in developing materials for hydrogen storage for cleaner vehicles, CO2 capture, energy-efficient adsorption separations, and atmospheric water harvesting. Some of our current work focuses on capture of PFAS and other pollutants from water. In the area of catalysis, we have worked on improved solid acid catalysts, selective oxidation, and destruction of chemical warfare agents by hydrolysis. The primary tools in our research are ab initio calculations (especially density functional theory); molecular simulations, including Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics; multiscale modeling; and machine learning. Our group has developed open-source software and publicly available databases used by research groups around the world.\nMuch of our work focuses on metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, which are synthesized in a building block approach from metal \"nodes\" and organic \"linker\" molecules. An exciting feature of MOFs is their modular chemistry, which means that, by judicious choice of building blocks, their properties can be exquisitely tuned for desired applications. The vast space of materials has created exciting opportunities for many applications of MOFs, but it has also created a challenge: how do we rapidly identify the most promising materials among the millions of possibilities for a particular application? Because experimental trial-and-error is slow and expensive, we have developed an array of computational tools to solve this important over-arching problem. For example, we have developed methods to generate thousands of MOFs on the computer and to evaluate their properties in a high-throughput manner. In one of our earliest demonstrations of this approach, we generated over 100,000 MOFs on the computer and screened them computationally to find promising materials for storing natural gas on vehicles. One of the top performing materials was synthesized and tested by collaborators, and its performance agreed well with the predictions, validating the computational approach. More recently, we have developed machine learning (ML) methods to further accelerate their computational screening.", "Significant Recognition": "- Paul Emmett and Richard Kokes Lecture, Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 2023\n- Fellow of the International Adsorption Society, 2020\n- IChemE Senior Moulton Medal, 2020\n- Corresponding Member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 2019\n- Ernest W.

After completing the project, he went on to work as a project engineer for several projects for the Chicago Housing Authority and private clients. While working as a project engineer Mr. Santucci worked his way over to the Chicago Transit Authority - Brown Line Expansion Project. While on the CTA Brown Line Project he was promoted from project engineer to Quality Control Manager for a sixty-seven-million dollar contract as part of the expansion project. Upon completion of the project he was again promoted to Project Manager and ran several projects for the Chicago Public Schools System.\nAfter five years in the General Contracting world, Mr. Santucci decided to make a move into Commercial Real Estate and obtain his Managing Brokers License. As a Managing Broker he currently works as a partner with his father. Mr. Santucci has completed an excess of 500 lease transactions over the past ten years in 19 different states throughout the United States. Along with brokerage Mr. Santucci oversees the property management division which includes the management of over 85 commercial assets. Since his transition, our mid-size real estate business has seen significant growth.\n", "EXPERIENCE": "Avalon Realty Associates LLC & Affiliated CompaniesMember, Manager, Broker\nF.H.

One focus are plasticity mechanisms and how they restructure neuronal networks. We are particularly fascinated by the role of feedback from higher brain areas in the restructuring of networks and the information processing performed by the networks resulting from it, as it is observed in the olfactory system. To gain insight into these phenomena we investigate predominantly networks of simplified neuron models. Another focus is the coherent dynamics of networks of simple and more complex neurons, which underlie the rhythmic activity observed in many brain areas. We are particularly interested in the interaction of these emerging rhythms and the paradoxical response they can exhibit, which is opposite to that of the individual neurons making up the rhythm. In work on the visual system we have focused on biophysically detailed neuron models for neurons in the retina and on the development of visual cortex V1.\n\nA second area of interest has been the study of spatially extended dynamical systems with focus on pattern formation.

Lipids are made primarily of C and H (also N, P, O, and S).  As these atoms are incorporated into the lipid structure they preserve isotopic signals of both biological and environmental processes. The major advantage of lipids for geoscientists is that they can be preserved on very long timescales, and thus can archive information about past environments in sediments and rocks.  My research applies tools from organic geochemistry, microbiology, and stratigraphy to investigate microbial and biogeochemical cycling in both modern and ancient environments.\nA major ongoing portion of my research focuses on understanding what type of information is record by the hydrogen isotopic composition of lipids.  We know that D/H reflects environmental water, but it can also vary with humidity, salinity, and, most importantly for my research, microbial metabolism.  This work includes both in lab culturing experiments to expand the data base of isolate D/H, and field studies aimed at understanding the nuances of this technique in particular environments.\nOther current and past research topics include:\n- Geochemical modeling of aqueous environments to understand the energetic potential and limits of microbial life (Currently focused on the deep subsurface environment)\n- Neoproterozoic chemical evolution of the ocean-atmosphere system during extreme isotope excursions (mostly in Oman thus far, Chemostratigraphy, modeling, field work)\n- Carbonate sedimentology, stratigraphy, and geochemistry with an emphasis on microbialite preservation and morphology.", "Courses Taught": "- EARTH 331 - Field Problems in Sedimentary Geology\n- EARTH 370 - Geobiology", "Selected Publications": ""},

And yet, we do not need to relearn handwriting as our bones and muscles change. Our sensory-motor is equipped with a powerful machinery that modifies the previously acquired motor programs so as to compensate for changes in the body and in the surrounding environment. The activities of our research group are directed at understanding the biological and computational mechanisms underlying this remarkable ability to learn and adapt. At the same time, we wish to take advantage of this knowledge for designing new procedures and technologies that facilitate the recovery of motor functions lost to stroke and other injuries.\nBi-Directional Brain-Machine Interfaces\nWe are carried out a collaborative study for the development of brain-machine interfaces that may establish a bi-directional communication between the nervous system and external devices. This requires decoding neural activities for extracting motor intentions and creating patterns of stimulation that encode physical variables associated with the mechanical state of the controlled device. A long-term goal of this study is to facilitate the neural control through the control of the neural plasticity mechanisms that are normally allowing for motor learning.\nBody Machine Interface for Controlling Assistive Devices\nStroke and spinal cord injury survivors may experience severe difficulties in maneuvering and steering their wheelchairs. The combination of a person's limited mobility and an interface that requires a precise and inflexible manipulation is a source of problems. This highlights the need for the development of control interfaces that are tailored to the specific residual motor skills of the user. Motion tracking technology offers a convenient and flexible way of capturing the motions of a disabled user with limited mobility, as sensors can be placed virtually anywhere on the body and measure very small motions. We are investigating and developing new methods for controlling assistive devices (e.g. powered wheelchairs) using wearable sensors. Controlling the external device (wheelchair) is practiced in a virtual reality environment, which allows the device's interface to gradually change so as to fit with the patient's evolving skills. At the end of this process, we plan to apply the evolved interface to the actual device (wheelchair or robot) and test the efficacy of learning in the real-life context.\nComputational primitives for sensory-motor learning\nA number of electrophysiological studies have revealed a modular organization within the structure of the spinal cord. When a small electrical stimulation is delivered to a site in the lumbar spinal cord, a group of muscle is activated. The result of this activation is a field of forces that tend to drive the ipsilateral hindlimb toward a stable posture. Most remarkably, the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sites leads to a vectorial summation of the force fields generated by each site. These studies have suggested that the brain may generate complex motor behaviors by adding the force fields produced by multiple modules in the spinal cord. We are developing a theory of motor control based of the superposition of these force fields, which we consider as \"motor primitives\" in analogy with the language primitives used to generate unlimited sentences out of a finite vocabulary of words.\nMotor adaptation to changes in arm dynamics\nTo generate even the simplest movements of the arm, the brain must solve a complex problem of dynamics. The relation between the forces generated by the muscles of the arm and the ensuing movement is expressed by a system of complex nonlinear differential equations. A number of studies have suggested that the brain maintains an internal representation of this dynamical relation, not in the form of a mathematical expression but in the form of a transformation from desired movement to corresponding command. This type of representation has been called an \"internal model\". We are investigating the properties of internal models by observing how subjects interact with a robotic manipulator that applies a preprogrammed force field to their hand. This force fields constitutes a change in the dynamics that the subject's motor system must represent in order to move the hand as desired. The current experimental evidence indicate that the subjects have an accurate representation of the dependence of the force upon the state of motion of the limb. However, there is a surprising inability to represent correctly a perturbation that depends explicitly upon time. We wish to pursue this analysis to understand what are the mechanisms and the limitations of our ability to adapt to changes in limb dynamics.\nThe Representation of Time in the Sensory-Motor System\nAdvanced technology provide us with truly immersive virtual environments, including teleoperated robotic devices. In order to control movements from a distance, the human sensorimotor system has to overcome the effects of delay. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie haptic estimation in delayed environments. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of sensory and environmental delays on perception of surfaces stiffness. The results of the experiment indicate a systematic dependence of the estimated stiffness upon the delay between position and force. Understanding the neural processing of temporal information has implications that go far beyond technological application. How is time represented (if at all) in the nervous system? How does the brain recognize that different sensory events – for example, the sound and the force impulse generated by the impact of the hand with an object – are to be considered as simultaneous despite different neural delays? Do we process simultaneity as an equivalence relation? Answering these questions is critical to understand sensory-motor processing.\nUnderstanding Force Control\nWhen manipulating objects, we must control our hand motion as well as the interaction forces that arise from contact with the environment. At the level of musculoskeletal biomechanics, motions and forces are coupled by intrinsic limb impedance. However, it has yet to be established whether at the neural level the control of motion and force are coupled or independent. The objective of this study is to understand how the nervous system simultaneously controls hand movements and interaction forces during active haptic discrimination. We have found results suggesting the existence of independent neural controllers for arm motion and interaction forces. This evidence is offered by transcranial magnetic stimulation of posterior parietal cortex resulting in the differential disruption of the control of motion but not of force.\nRead a more detailed and extended list of research projects that are ongoing in the Robotics Laboratory of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/Robotics-Lab/projects).", "Selected Publications": "Full list of publications (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i26AbOYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)\nFarshchian, A., A.

We are interested in the capacity and specificity of the protein quality control machinery to recognize misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins and the role of molecular chaperones and degradative machines in the triage clearance mechanism. We have established C. elegans transgenic lines expressing polyglutamine proteins (Huntingtin and Ataxin 3), mutant SOD1, tau, and prions to screen for modifiers and suppressors and to establish the basis of neuronal cell-type specificity. We have identified a molecular link between the insulin signaling pathway, accumulation of damaged proteins, and regulation of the heat shock response and chaperones revealing that genes that control longevity also suppress protein misfolding. The identification of the protein quality control proteome thus forms the basis for a new class of therapeutics targeting HSF1 and molecular chaperones for neurodegenerative diseases of aging, (2) Transcriptional regulation of the heat shock response. The role of stress sensors that control HSF1 activation during acute stress and recovery, during aging in response to neurohormonal stress signaling molecules, and as a general regulator of protein homeostasis and suppressor of misfolded proteins, and (3) Systems approach to stress biology.

Chemical Engineering (Hons), Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA", "Research Interests": "- As part of the DOE Urban Integrated Field Laboratory CROCUS (Community Research on Climate & Urban Science) project led by Argonne National Lab and other projects funded by the Walder Foundation and National Science Foundation (NSF), my colleagues and I are installing hydrological and biogeochemical sensors in Chicago and its suburbs to quantify the benefits of nature-based solutions for addressing climate change with a focus on mitigating flooding from stormwater. Current and planned sensor locations include Scott Hall on Northwestern’s Evanston campus, the future site of the Garfield Park Eco-Orchard, the Academy for Global Citizenship charter school in Garfield Ridge, Indian Boundary Prairies in Markham, and Blacks in Green properties in West Woodlawn.\n- The increasing pace of environmental change, especially climate change, exacerbates existing threats to the livelihoods and wellbeing of many Native American nations across the United States. For example, climate change exacerbates the effects that invasive species, mining, and development have on critical ecosystems that provide food, water, and cultural security for Indigenous Peoples. Working with tribal partners, two NSF-funded tribally-driven projects adopt an integrative framework to synthesize traditional and scientific knowledge to advance innovations in three areas: (1) Environmental Science: the project is deploying state-of-the-art sensing platforms to continuously measure water and ecosystems conditions, and to assess the effects of climate change, mining contaminants, and oil/gas pipeline failures on nutritionally and culturally important and environmentally sensitive manoomin (wild rice) and associated wetland ecosystems; (2) Governance: the project will assess the effects of how scientific knowledge generated through a traditional knowledge framework impacts tribal planning and governance by co-producing and evaluating culturally appropriate resilience indicators for anticipating, responding to, and mitigating acute and chronic socio-ecological perturbations; and (3) Community Impact: the project will co-develop and deploy a dynamic, integrated cyberinfrastructure platform that connects diverse end-users with data and analyses to examine how access to data strengthens tribal sovereignty and resilience. I co-lead the community engagement and education efforts and contribute to environmental science.\n- I am part of the Chicago Wilderness Alliance (CWA) team developing a Climate Action Plan for People and Nature to complement climate action plans developed by the City of Chicago and regional agencies. In 2010, the CWA published The Chicago Wilderness Climate Action Plan for Nature (CAPN), which was aimed at addressing the significant role of, and threats to, regional natural area conservation in the face of climate change. Now, in 2024, it is time to update and reevaluate CAPN – and in the process strengthen its commitments to nature and emphasize the interconnections between people and nature. The CWA is working to address climate change and its impacts in the Chicago Wilderness region by engaging a diverse array of communities and stakeholders to reduce regional emissions, institute equitable solutions that build climate resilience, and expand the suite of nature-based mitigation and adaptation activities. In updating CAPN, the CWA recognizes the need to co-create an inclusive and equitable climate strategy to accelerate impactful nature-based solutions for nature and people across the CWA Region.", "Selected Publications": "\"Energy Sprawl or Energy Efficiency: Climate Policy Impacts on Natural Habitat for the United States of America,\" R.I.

However, it is remarkable, by and large, how ineffectively mathematics has been leveraged in furthering our understanding of Life. Mathematics isn't just a convenient language to communicate models of how some little corner of Life works, at its most powerful it provides a general framework that organizes and illuminates a vast diversity of phenomena. Mathematics, and mathematical scientists, achieve this through abstraction. And it is through abstraction that general and simplifying principles can be distilled -- As with Picasso's Bulls. What new abstractions must we seek out to deepen our understanding of Life?\n​\nWhat we do: Our group pursues lines of inquiry where we attempt to develop novel mathematical abstractions that provide insights into biological phenomena and data. Precisely by virtue of our pursuit of discovering general mathematical abstractions, we are compelled to work on a diversity of biological phenomena that have been classified by the community into distinct and unrelated categories. These include organismal development, cellular physiology and structure, and ecological dynamics.\n​\nHow we do it: These mathematical abstractions are pursued working closely with modern biological data. And, thus, data-driven and AI approaches are a large part of the algorithms we use and develop. Pairing these approaches with the aesthetics and sensibilities of mathematics and theoretical physics is the middle ground we strive to inhabit. All our work is conducted within the context of long-term collaborations with experimental biology groups.\n​\nOur scientific vision is a corollary to a human vision of helping young scientists enjoy the pursuit of mathematics and science, developing their talents and tastes.", "Significant Recognition": "- Simons Postdoctoral Fellowship, 2010 - 2013\n- Derek Bok Undergraduate Teaching Award, Harvard University, 2009\n- Robert L.

Data science methods promise rapid, automated, descriptions and predictions for complex systems, generally without knowledge of underlying mechanism. Statistics allow us to evaluate how well our models describe a system, given the data. By combining methods, I will rapidly develop explanatory mechanistic models and use them to optimize system performance and design engineering solutions.\nData-driven methods for inferring nonlinear dynamics on biological networks.\nInferring the structure and dynamics of biological networks is critical to understanding and controlling their functionality. I am particularly interested in methods that bridge the gap between -omics level inference and the dynamic interaction of a few metabolic enzymes or regulatory elements in a gene network.\nSpatial organization in cells to enhance throughput of biochemical pathways\nI am interested in bioengineering of spatial organization in bacteria as a way of producing high-value products like biofuels, alternatives to plastic, and pharmaceuticals.\nSystems-level modeling to optimize renewable energy systems.\nI am passionate about research which enhances alternative energy.

This predictability fundamentally changes how we design learning systems, making it possible to forecast performance and allocate resources optimally. However, this kind of reliable scaling behavior is far from universal. In many settings—especially when models interact with complex structure, constraints, or long-horizon dynamics—scaling breaks down: optimization becomes unstable, hyperparameters stop transferring across model sizes, and accuracy plateaus despite increased compute.\nMy research aims to build a general theory and algorithmic framework for scalable learning, in which increased resources provably and reliably lead to better performance. Rather than treating scaling as an empirical phenomenon, I study it as a principled question of optimization geometry, statistical complexity, and resource allocation.\n", "Selected Publications": "1.A Simple Unbiased Guidance for Diffusion Models via Sequential Monte Carlo on Path Measures, to be submitted to ICML 2026\n2.On the Width Scaling of Neural Optimizers Under Matrix Operator Norms I: Making Operators Play Nice Together to be submitted to Mathematics of Operations Research\n3.Ruihan Xu, Yiping Lu, What is a Sketch-and-Precondition Derivation for Low-Rank Approximation?

To do so, we re-use, re-purpose and re-engineer natural biological systems using cutting-edge approaches from synthetic biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and computer science. Our work combines experiment, theory and computation to tackle two key questions that span discovery to design: (1) How do cells sense and process information to respond to changing environments; and (2) How can we engineer molecular sensing and information processing to develop low-cost, accessible diagnostic and therapeutic technologies to benefit society. While we work on a broad range of problems, our current research is focused on two key areas:\n\nDeveloping new AI-directed approaches to understand and design molecular folding and function. Recent advances in deep learning have created new approaches to predicting and designing protein folding and function. However, major gaps remain in cracking the RNA folding problem. RNA’s play central roles in almost all processes of life – from controlling gene expression to performing catalysis – yet we still cannot reliably predict and design the complex interplay between RNA sequence, dynamic folding and these functions. To tackle this challenge the Lucks Group is pioneering two new approaches: (1) megascale experimental pipelines that leverage next-generation sequencing to measure the folding thermodynamics and functions of RNAs; and (2) the development of new AI models that train on this data to predict and design RNA folding and function. In addition to developing these approaches, we are applying them to design new classes of RNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\nEngineering biosensing systems for diagnostics, therapeutics and smart materials. Many next-generation biotechnologies will require ‘smart’ molecular systems that can sense and respond to changing signals. Inspired by the abilities of natural cells, the Lucks Lab is engineering a platform technology that can be integrated across different biotechnologies based on biosensors - DNA, RNA and protein mechanisms that bind to chemical signatures and activate genetic processes. In the context of diagnostics, the Lucks Lab has pioneered new approaches to configure biosensors to work in ‘cell free’ reactions that can be assembled, freeze dried, and used at the point-of-need in a simple ‘just add water’ format. The Lucks Lab is working on developing sensors for water and food quality, and human health, and in collaboration with anthropologists, is currently field testing these systems in Chicago for household water quality monitoring. We are also integrating these biosensing systems to design new classes of smart therapeutics and are integrating them into biomaterials to detect compounds in agricultural applications.\n", "Selected Publications": ""},

To keep up with the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles, allow for grid scale energy storage, and meet the demands of future technological advances, new materials for high energy density batteries must be developed. High costs have prevented widespread deployment of lithium ion batteries beyond portable electronics, and the safety hazards of exothermic reactions associated with traditional materials during cell failure remain to be fully addressed. Therefore, strategies to enhance the mechanical and chemical stability of next-generation electrode materials are key to the successful integration of batteries into our future energy systems.\nOverall, the goal of our work is to identify and understand molecular phenomena that can be utilized to design and develop materials that address challenges related to enabling next-generation battery chemistries. Using advanced electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization techniques we aim to answer questions regarding the solvation structure of ions in electrolytes as well as the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions at electrode interfaces. We are specifically interested in development of new materials to stabilize reactive lithium metal anodes and Ni-rich metal oxide cathodes, new electrolytes for fast and selective ion transport, and polymers with adaptive mechanical properties for applications in flexible, stretchable, and resilient batteries. Furthermore, we utilize tools for automated experimentation and high throughput analysis to accelerate the process of materials discovery and development.", "Selected Publications": ""},

Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI", "Research Interests": "Catalysis science, energy conversion and storage, catalytic water purification\nDeveloping new materials and processes for a sustainable world is a challenging but rewarding goal. The current emphases of our research focus on novel catalytic materials and reactions that would facilitate and enhance  environmentally friendly, energy- and material-efficient chemical processes, and on new materials that enable capturing waste energy or reduce waste energy in processing and manufacturing.\nHighly efficient catalysts minimize energy consumption and environmental impact by reducing waste generation and material consumption and simplifying process complexity. The ability to design such catalysts relies on our level of understanding of catalytic reactions and the available synthetic tools. Our prospect to achieve this is greatly improved by the recent rapid advances in synthesis capabilities, consequence of developments in nanotechnology, and in atomistic characterization of catalytic systems. They enable design and synthesis of catalytic materials that model after natural enzymes, which are among the most active and selective known catalysts.\nOur group has been acquiring the skill set needed to introduce enzyme-like functionalities into nonbiological materials so as to capture the reactivity and reaction specificity of the enzymes without the constraint of sensitivity to processing conditions that they exhibit. Currently, we focus on the design and synthesis of catalytic materials that exhibit two unique properties of enzymes: cooperative effect in which two or more functional groups interact cooperatively to enhance the catalytic activity and specificity, and confinement effect which manifests the influence on the immediately surroundings on the properties of the active center. We have successfully completed the first synthesis of an asymmetric bicyclic siloxane, as well as spherical nanocages of siloxane and carbosilanes with interior functional groups and molecular size-selectivity for access to the cage interior. We have successfully synthesized the first heterogenized, Lewis acidic Sn-oxo unit that also produces Brønsted acidity upon adsorption of alcohol.  We have demonstrated the importance of metal-support oxide interfacial perimeters sites in selective propane oxidation to acetone    Our current activity includes designing structures that anchor multiple functional groups to understand the conditions for cooperativity, and apply these structures to for highly selective catalytic reactions.\nThere are many different types of waste energy.  One is small amplitude motions, such as vibration.  Piezoelectric materials can convert motion into electricity, but the conversion efficiency is very low.  We are exploring new types of materials for such purposes.  Waste heat in process streams is another source of waste energy that can be minimized if degradation of heat exchanger surfaces can be prevented.  We are examining how chemical properties and morphology of heat exchange surfaces affect scaling and biofouling.", "Selected Publications": "- Linping Qian, Zhen Wang, Evgeny V.

Unlike human-made materials, biological systems are strikingly robust to errors in the face of dynamic, out-of-equilibrium environments. Living matter corrects errors across six orders of magnitude: nanometer-scale kinetic proofreading achieves exponentially lower error rates in DNA replication than can be reached at equilibrium, and millimeter-scale vasculature rapidly remodels in response to changes in blood flow. Because many biological systems are capable of robust error correction, it should be possible to design synthetic materials with similar functions. Error-correcting materials would revolutionize modern technologies, ranging from artificial joints that could be revitalized with error-correcting synthetic enzymes to last a lifetime instead of just a decade, to phone screens that repair themselves while recharging overnight. Creating these materials will require both fundamental discoveries in the physical and biological laws that govern these complex, dynamic interactions and innovations in computational and inverse design methods. So how do we design error-correcting materials without the luxury of billions of years of evolution? Come join us, we aim to learn how.", "Selected Publications": "- King, E. M., Du, C. X., Zhu, Q.

A core feature of our group is defining how we strategically use waste as substrates key to our energy future. Equipped with a holistic approach to biotechnology, our research is at the frontier of expanding the scope, scale, and impact of cell-free manufacturing.\n\nOur research focuses on how we can capture and convert any pollutant, anywhere. Towards this goal, my lab operates across the molecular, system, and process scales to enable novel bioprocesses for climate change mitigation and adaptation. We are integrating synthetic biology and bioprocess engineering by mixing cell-free systems, metabolic engineering, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing—working together to address scientific and technological gaps in engineering biology for sustainability. We have projects in the lab focused on increasing our ability to biorecover resources from waste, biorecycle materials, and biocapture carbon. The ability to sequester and degrade pollutants through biological processes will significantly impact all industries, people, and the planet.", "Selected Publications": "- Rezvani, Ryan N.; Aw, Rochelle; Chan, Wei; Satish, Krishnathreya; Chen, Han; Lavy, Adi; Rimal, Swechha; Patel, Divyesh A.; Rao, Govind; Swartz, James R.; DeLisa, Matthew P.; Kvam, Erik; Karim, Ashty S.; Krüger, Antje; Kightlinger, Weston; Jewett, Michael C.,\n- Scalable Cell-Free Production of Active T7 RNA Polymerase\n- , Biotechnology and Bioengineering (2025).\n- Brown, Dylan M.; Phillips, Daniel A.; Garcia, David C.; Arce, Anibal; Lucci, Tyler; Davies, John P.; Mangini, Jacob T.; Rhea, Katherine A.; Bernhards, Casey B.; Biondo, John R.; Blum, Steven M.; Cole, Stephanie D.; Lee, Jennifer A.; Lee, Marilyn S.; McDonald, Nathan D.; Wang, Brenda; Perdue, Dale L.; Bower, Xavier S.; Thavarajah, Walter; Karim, Ashty S.; Lux, Matthew W.; Jewett, Michael C.; Miklos, Aleksandr E.; Lucks, Julius B.,\n- Semiautomated Production of Cell-Free Biosensors\n- , ACS synthetic biology (2025).\n- Lay, Caleb G.; Burks, Gabriel R.; Li, Zheng; Barrick, Jeffrey E.; Schroeder, Charles M.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael C.,\n- Cell-Free Expression of Soluble Leafhopper Proteins from Brochosomes\n- , ACS synthetic biology (2025).\n- Hunt, Andrew C.; Rasor, Blake J.; Seki, Kosuke; Ekas, Holly M.; Warfel, Katherine F.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael C.,\n- Cell-Free Gene Expression\n- , Chemical Reviews (2025).\n- Karim, Ashty Stephen; Brown, Dylan M.; Archuleta, Chloé M.; Grannan, Sharisse; Aristilde, Ludmilla; Goyal, Yogesh; Leonard, Joshua N; Mangan, Niall M.; Prindle, Arthur; Rocklin, Gabriel J.; Tyo, Keith J.; Zoloth, Laurie S; Jewett, Michael Christopher; Calkins, Susanna C; Kamat, Neha P.; Tullman-Ercek, Danielle; Lucks, Julius B.,\n- Deconstructing synthetic biology across scales\n- , Nature communications (2024).\n- Ekas, Holly M.; Wang, Brenda; Silverman, Adam D.; Lucks, Julius B.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael C.,\n- An Automated Cell-Free Workflow for Transcription Factor Engineering\n- , ACS synthetic biology (2024).\n- Ekas, Holly M.; Wang, Brenda; Silverman, Adam D.; Lucks, Julius B.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael C.,\n- Engineering a PbrR-Based Biosensor for Cell-Free Detection of Lead at the Legal Limit\n- , ACS synthetic biology (2024).\n- Willi, Jessica A.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael Christopher,\n- Cell-Free Translation Quantification via a Fluorescent Minihelix\n- , ACS synthetic biology (2024)."},

Further “firsts” include the use of synchrotron scanning Mößbauer spectroscopy (sSMS) to study iron biominerals, sub-micron probe X-ray diffraction mapping of enamel crystallographic parameters and composition at the mesoscale, the use of synchrotron micro-computed tomography (SMCT) for analysis of surface zones in rat caries lesions, development of a droplet microfluidic nucleation rate assays, and large scale automated segmentation of SMCT reconstructions of mouse jaws and rat molars using machine learning.", "Significant Recognition": "- Full Scholarship at the GEM4 Summer School, 2006\n- JSP Fellow at the Bürgenstock Conference on Stereochemistry, 2006\n- Minerva Fellow, 2005-2007\n- Friends of the Weizmann-Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship, 2003-2005\n- ETH-Scholarship, 1999-2000\n- Fulbright-Scholarship, 1994-1995\n- Dr. Nathorff-Einstein Award, 1992\n- Award of the Fonds of the German Chemical Industry, 1992", "Significant Professional Service": "- Member of ACS and MRS", "Selected Publications": "X.

He is responsible for Segal programming and experience, oversees teaching faculty and staff, teaches undergraduate and graduate level design innovation coursework across the Segal portfolio, and collaborates with McCormick – developing and driving messaging and point of view, internally and externally.\nHolderfield works closely with former Dean Julio M Ottino of McCormick to set a collaborative trajectory within the school of engineering and with the Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Kellogg School of Management – creating a “design innovation for all” platform for Northwestern University. He also collaborates with the Kellogg Co-Director and the MMM Student Executive Council (MMMSec), setting priorities, managing resources, designing student experiences, messaging, recruitment, curriculum, external partnerships, and faculty.\nHolderfield's role as a faculty member at Northwestern University is to create the best conditions for learning, which his research has shown to be based upon a studio culture that supports true multi-disciplinary collaboration, the sharing of ideas, constructive critique, curiosity, creative expression and making. Additionally, he is a hands-on educator who leverages his years of professional practice to authentically inspire and challenge students to go deeper in their own work by pushing boundaries, asking tough questions, and ultimately discovering and developing meaningful solutions that inspire.\nWhile Segal embraces design from all perspectives and domains, Holderfield’s personal expertise is focused on human-centered and aesthetic/emotional approaches to innovation, which are universally applicable to any area of the human experience. These approaches leverage design thinking methods, a maker culture, creative exploration, and business perspectives.\nHolderfield further claims that these approaches are best learned through highly interactive and contextually engaging experiences that enable and empower students to understand the actual underlying problem. It starts with putting students directly in the context of the problem space, where they understand stakeholder needs first-hand. This deep understanding allows them to gain empathy, which ultimately frames the opportunity in a way that is meaningful to people. These opportunity frameworks inform the generation of conceptual ideas, which are then prototyped and tested, and iterated upon using constructive feedback loops. Lastly, students build outcomes that are not only original but desirable, feasible, and viable.\nUltimately, these approaches are deeply personal, interactive, and iterative. A student's ability to learn comes about through a deep and rigorous immersion that is facilitated through project-based experiences, rather than theoretical simulations.", "Significant Recognition": "- Four “Intentional Design Excellence Awards” (IDEA), Business Week and the Industrial Design Society of America (IDSA), including the \"Gold\" for Industrial Equipment Design\n- Two German “Red Dot” awards\n- Japan \"Good Design\" award\n- IF International Design Forum award", "Significant Professional Service": "- Vice President of Design and Strategy at ARC Worldwide - Leo Burnett\n- Director of Strategic Design Innovation at HLB\n- Global Design Jury for the International Design Excellence Awards", "Patents": "Professor Holderfield also holds 44 design and utility patents."},

For the first, my lab collects samples in the field, such as by vacuuming dust in buildings, and uses shotgun DNA sequencing along with other -omics methods to detect genes or proteins of interest. We combine these data with analytical chemistry measurements to obtain statistical correlations between chemicals and traits of interest. For the second, we maintain and develop model organisms and bacterial communities to determine what responses are elicited by chemicals or treatments of interest.

His involvement in research started at a young age with an appointment as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Between his undergraduate and graduate studies, he also completed an internship at Barr Engineering Company in Minneapolis. After being awarded his Ph.D. in 2010, he joined the Centre for Geotechnical and Materials Modelling at The University of Newcastle, Australia, first as a Post-doctoral Research Associate (Lecturer) and then as a Research Academic (Senior Lecturer). In the latter role, he was a key member and collaborator within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Geotechnical Science and Engineering (CGSE), a joint initiative between The University of Newcastle, The University of Western Australia, the University of Wollongong, and various industry partners. He joined the Faculty in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University in October 2016.", "Research Interests": "Dr. Hambleton’s main research interests are in computational plasticity, geotechnical analysis, contact mechanics, soil-machine interaction, and the analysis of problems involving unsteady plastic flow. A major focal point of his work over the coming years is to advance the understanding of how soils are moved and shaped through interaction with man-made objects and machinery. The overarching goal of these activities is to develop rigorous, mechanics-based models for predicting soil deformation and the corresponding force requirements or reactions. From a theoretical perspective, problems involving soil-machine interaction pose a tremendous challenge due to the confluence of unsteady plastic flow, potentially three-dimensional deformation, contact interaction, material instabilities, and rate effects from inertial forces and hydromechanical coupling (for saturated or partially saturated soils). This work endeavors to discover new modelling paradigms to help establish accurate, robust, and efficient computational methods. From a practical viewpoint, the scale of operations involving soil-machine interaction across the face of the Earth is difficult to fathom. For housing excavations, mineral production, and road building alone, each individual moves several tons of earth each year when distributed evenly across the world’s population. Breakthroughs in understanding will therefore have profound long-term effects with respect to reducing costs and production times, as well as mitigating consumption and pollution.\nDr. Hambleton’s specific areas of interest include\n•           plowing (ploughing) and cutting of soils and rocks in earthmoving operations,\n•           installation processes for screw anchors and screw foundations,\n•           penetration-based testing for in situ characterization of soil strength and deformability, and\n•           soil-wheel interaction for off-road vehicles.", "Significant Recognition": "- 2015, Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award\n- 2014, New Faces of Civil Engineering Honoree, American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)\n- 2014, Excellent Paper Award, International Association for Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics\n- 2010, Neville G.

He has also advanced the understanding of dynamics in amorphous systems that undergo anomalous diffusion. New methods in resistive tomographic imaging are being explored for 3D bioimaging as well as 2D artificial skin sensor applications. Laboratory measurement capabilities include electron transport over a continuous temperature range from 15 mK to 400 K, and high magnetic fields up to 17 T. Systems of interest are thermoelectrics, aisotropic conductors, Luttinger liquids, quantum Hall ferromagnets, Type II superlattices, and multivalley quantum systems. Matthew completed his PhD studies at Princeton University with Prof. Daniel Tsui studying tunnel spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall effect edges. His post-doc work at the University of Maryland investigated the infrared Hall angle of cuprate superconducting films. He then won a Humboldt Fellowship to research in Germany at the Walter Schottky Institut of the Technische Universitaet Muenchen, where he remained for 7 years leading his own research sub-group. He joined Northwestern in 2007 and has been an associate professor since 2012, and full professor since 2018 in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Northwestern University", "Selected Publications": "- Aygen, Can; Richards, Michael; Yazdaanpanah, Ramin; Kulkarni, Sachin; Tanriover, Ibrahim; Onsager, Claire; Lin, Bo Yen; Lee, Jiun Haw; Aydin, Koray; Grayson, Matthew A.,\n- Degradation of Organic LEDs Characterized with Algebraic Decay Relaxation Function\n- , SPIE (2025).\n- Sheflin, Jessie; Bah, Amadou; Ganeshan, Sankalp K.; Onsager, Claire C.; Sahakian, Alan; Bulst, Martin; Grayson, Matthew A,\n- Parametric EIT inversion with sparse model sampling\n- , Journal of Physics: Conference Series (2025).\n- Aygen, Can C.; Cravey, Christopher; Luo, Jiajun; Williams, James; Buchholz, D.

His experience bridging the business and academic communities informs his efforts at the MBAi program.  His goal is to harness Northwestern and industry resources to produce graduates with a realistic understanding of what kind of industry problems can be addressed with AI and related technologies, what it takes to deploy such systems, and what it means to do so in a responsible manner."},

In addition to using an in-house X-ray lab, they make extensive use of synchrotron X-ray facilities, which provide greatly enhanced chemical and structural sensitivity for studying systems as dilute as one-hundredth of an atomic monolayer.\nBedzyk employs various conventional X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques and has developed a number of novel methods for generating X-ray standing waves with characteristic length scales ranging from nanometers to micrometers. These periodic X-ray probes are used to pinpoint the lattice location of adsorbate atoms on crystalline surfaces, to measure strain within epitaxially grown semiconductor and ferroelectric thin films, to locate heavy atoms within ordered ultrathin organic films, and to study polyion adsorption at charged liquid/solid interfaces.", "Significant Recognition": "- Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2012\n- Fellow, American Physical Society, 1998\n- Bertram Eugene Warren Diffraction Physics Award, American Crystallographic Association, 1994", "Significant Professional Service": "- Management Board for DuPont-Northwestern-Dow- Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source\n- Director of the X-ray Diffraction Facility at NU\n- Visiting research scientist, Argonne National Laboratory\n- Professor of Physics and Astronomy (Joint Courtesy Appointment)", "Selected Publications": "Majumder, S., Shinde, N., Cavin, J., Chen, C., Dey, A.

Often the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very machines created to assist them. My lab endows assistive machines with customized robotics autonomy and intelligence to address this confound. Robots already synthetically sense, act in, and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor, or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines.\n\nA fundamental question that arises time and again throughout many of our projects is how exactly to share control between the robot and the human user, and how to adapt these control formulations over time as the human changes. We are working with a range of hardware platforms, from a smart wheelchair to assistive robotic arms.\n\nBy offloading control burden, we aim to increase access, ability, and independence—to advance human autonomy through robotics autonomy.", "Selected Publications": "- Loke, Larisa Y.C.; Barsoum, Demiana R.; Murphey, Todd D.; Argall, Brenna D.,\n- Characterizing eye gaze and mental workload for assistive device control\n- , Wearable Technologies (2025).\n- Javaremi, Mahdieh Nejati; Loke, Larisa Y.C.; Argall, Brenna,\n- Interface-Aware Assistance for 7-DoF Robot Arm Teleoperation\n- , Springer Nature (2024).\n- Lee, Jongmin M.; Gebrekristos, Temesgen; Santis, Dalia D.E.; Nejati-Javaremi, Mahdieh; Gopinath, Deepak; Parikh, Biraj; Mussa Ivaldi, Ferdinando; Argall, Brenna D.,\n- Learning to Control Complex Robots Using High-Dimensional Body-Machine Interfaces\n- , ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction (2024).\n- Thompson, Andrew; Rizzoglio, Fabio; Neylon, Fiona A.; Barsoum, Demiana R.; Ammon, Lucy E.; McCune, Maximus N.; Miller, Lee; Argall, Brenna,\n- An Evolution of Assistive Robot Control to Meet End-User Ability\n- , IEEE Computer Society (2024).\n- Gopinath, Deepak E.; Thompson, Andrew; Argall, Brenna D.,\n- Information Theoretic Intent Disambiguation via Contextual Nudges for Assistive Shared Control\n- , Springer Nature (2023).\n- Pinosky, Allison; Abraham, Ian; Broad, Alexander; Argall, Brenna; Murphey, Todd D.,\n- Hybrid control for combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning\n- , International Journal of Robotics Research (2023).\n- Abraham, Ian; Broad, Alexander; Pinosky, Allison; Argall, Brenna; Murphey, Todd D.,\n- Hybrid Control for Learning Motor Skills\n- , Springer Science and Business Media B.V.:450-466 (2021).\n- Broad, Alexander; Abraham, Ian; Murphey, Todd; Argall, Brenna,\n- Data-driven Koopman operators for model-based shared control of human–machine systems\n- , International Journal of Robotics Research 39(9):1178-1195 (2020).\n", "Brenna Argall In the News": "Professor Brenna Argall featured on Mission Unstoppable (https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2021/03/professor-brenna-argall-featured-on-mission-nstoppable.html)\nCrain's 40 Under 40 (https://www.chicagobusiness.com/static/section/40-under-40-2016@recipient=argall.html?recipient=Argall)"},

Such nitrogen removal enhances the performance of catalytic processes which upgrade light hydrocarbons, especially light olefins, such as isomerization and etherification. The nitrogen-removal process can usefully be combined with steps for removal of sulfur compounds and highly unsaturated compounds in a process combination for upgrading the light hydrocarbons.\nUS6015933\n 2000-01-18\nProcess for removing polymeric by-products from acetylene hydrogenation product\n Abrevaya; Hayim; Vora; Bipin V.\n UOP LLC\nA process to remove polymeric by-products from the product of an acetylene selective hydrogenation reactor has been developed. The product is generated by introducing hydrogen and a liquid hydrocarbon stream containing largely butadiene and some acetylenes to a reactor containing a catalyst effective for the selective hydrogenation of acetylenes. The product contains at least hydrogen, butadiene, and polymeric by-products. The pressure of the product is reduced and the product cooled. The cooled product is conducted to a low pressure flash drum to produce a hydrogen enriched stream and a butadiene and polymeric by-product-enriched stream. The hydrogen-enriched stream is removed. The butadiene and polymeric by-product is passed to a knockout drum to produce a stream enriched in butadiene and polymeric by-products having less than about 12 carbon atoms and a stream enriched in polymeric by-products having about 12 or more carbon atoms. The stream enriched in polymeric by-products having about 12 or more carbon atoms is removed from the process. Polymeric by-products containing less than about 12 carbon atoms may be removed from the remaining stream by conducting a solvent and the stream enriched in butadiene and polymeric by-products containing less than about 12 carbon atoms to an extractive distillation column. In the extractive distillation column, the butadiene and polymeric by-products containing less than about 12 carbon atoms are carried with the solvent and removed in a bottoms stream as an extract mixture while the butanes and butenes are removed in an extractive distillation overhead stream. The bottoms extract stream is conducted to a stripper column where the solvent and the polymeric by-products are separated from the butadiene.\nUS6143915\n 2000-11-07\nReaction process in hybrid reactor for propylene ammoxidation\n Zhou; Lubo; Dennler; W. Patrick; Oroskar; Anil R.; Vora; Bipin V.; Abrevaya; Hayim; Stine; Laurence O.\n UOP LLC\nA hybrid reactor arrangement provides a reactive design that achieves higher acrylonitrile yield and lower catalyst circulating rate. The hybrid reactor design first passes a mixture of reactants and catalyst through a circulating bubbling bed reaction section. Heat exchange coils or other cooling medium in the bubbling bed reactor section maintain temperature in a range that will maximize the selectivity of reactants to the acrylonitrile product. The bubbling bed reactor section provides the initial conversion of the reactant. A circulating fluidized bed reaction zone finishes the conversion of reactants to a high yield under conditions that reduce the occurrence of secondary reactions that could otherwise produce unwanted by-products. The circulating fluidized bed reactor section maintains nearly plug flow conditions that allow continued conversion of unreacted feed components through primary reactions while limiting the time for secondary reactions to continue and diminish the final yield of products. Selectivity and conversion may also be improved by sequential addition of oxygen into the CFB reaction section. The sequential addition of oxygen may occur by the direct injection of an oxygen-containing gas or by the delivery of re-oxidized catalyst particles that are fully recharged with the lattice oxygen necessary for the reaction. Through this method the hybrid reactor provides the typical 5% improvement of higher acrylonitrile product yield from CFB-type reaction zones while reducing the required catalyst circulation by a factor of 10 or more.\nUS6649802\n 2003-11-18\nLayered oligomerization catalyst system\n Frame; Robert R.; Jan; Den-Yang; Abrevaya; Hayim\n UOP LLC\nA process is disclosed for the oligomerization of light olefins to higher olefins. The process uses a catalyst that has an inert core and a thin layer of molecular sieve applied to the inert core. The molecular sieve is a crystalline silicoaluminate or metalloaluminophosphate and provides the acid sites for the oligomerization reactions. The thin layer provides for more selective control and limits the amount of oligomerization for liquid phase oligomerization processes.\nUS6689927\n 2004-02-10\nProcess for oligomer production and saturation\n Frame; Robert R.; Stine; Laurence O.; Abrevaya; Hayim\n UOP LCC\nA process for the production of C8 alkenes with high selectivities to 2,4,4-trimethylpentene by the oligomerization of isobutene and/or n-butene at lower temperatures is disclosed. Higher proportions of heavy paraffins mixed with the butene feed in the oligomerization zone improve the selectivity to 2,4,4-trimethylpentene along with better selectivity to octene and lower selectivity to dodecene. Additionally, we have found that n-butene codimerizes with isobutene selectively to 2,4,4-trimethylpentene.\nUS6791002\n 2004-09-14\nRiser reactor system for hydrocarbon cracking\n Abrevaya; Hayim; Walenga; Joel T.; Schultz; Michael A.; Oroskar; Anil R.\n UOP LLC\nA riser reactor system for conversion of hydrocarbon feedstock to ethylene and propylene is described.

This design approach opens an exciting and bottomless field, in which one “zooms in” to the scale of materials defects to unravel new phenomena and physics. Abdeljawad’s group employs theoretical analysis, atomistic simulations, and mesoscale computational modeling to understand how materials microstructures form and evolve during processing treatments or under operating conditions—laying the scientific foundation for the next generation of advanced materials.  Abdeljawad’s group complements these computational efforts with machine learning frameworks that enable efficient, low-cost exploration of complex process–structure–property relationships. Abdeljawad’s research spans a wide range of problems including grain boundary chemistry and dynamics, defects in two-dimensional materials, materials for extremes, nanoscale sintering, microstructure development in 3D printing, metallic glasses, and evolving morphologies in energy devices.", "Significant Recognition": "- Outstanding Doctoral Student Advising Award, Lehigh University, 2025\n- Early Career Faculty Fellow Award, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS), 2022\n- Junior Researcher Award, College of Engineering, Clemson University, 2022\n- Bob and Kays Stanzione Endowed Professorship, Clemson University, 2022\n- Dean's Faculty Fellow, College of Engineering, Clemson University, 2021\n- NSF Track IV Junior Faculty Fellow, National Science Foundation, 2021\n- Army Research Office Young Investigator Program Award, 2020\n- Byars Prize for Excellence in Teaching, College of Engineering, Clemson University, 2020\n- The Eastman Junior Faculty Award, Clemson University, 2020\n- International Young Scholar Award, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS), 2019\n- Ralph E.
